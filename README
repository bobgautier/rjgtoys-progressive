rjgtoys.progressive: Progressive operations

This module provides a simple way to implement operations that
can take so long that you might need to display a 'progress
tracker' for the user so they know what's going on.

The tools in this module help you to take a time-consuming
method and wrap it up in a Python thread in such a way that
the caller can start the operation and then monitor it until
completion without really worrying much about the details
of threading and so on.
